# Atrium_segmentation_using_UNET

After segmentation, we compute the volume ratio of right to left atria, obtaining a smaller ratio that indicates better restoration. Hence, the proposed technique allows to evaluate the surgical success of atrial septal occlusion and may support diagnosis regarding the accurate evaluation of atrial septal defects before and after occlusion procedures.
